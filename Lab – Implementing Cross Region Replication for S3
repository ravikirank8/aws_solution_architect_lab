Create two S3 buckets in different regions.

First bucket must be in us-east-1 region and bucket name must start with prefix kk-content-.
Second bucket must be in us-west-2 region and bucket name must start with prefix kk-backup-.
Enable versioning on both buckets.

Is kk-content- bucket created in us-east-1 region?

Is kk-backup- bucket created in us-west-2 region?

In your AWS console, navigate to S3 service.

Create the first bucket with name kk-content-<name> in us-east-1 region.
Create the second bucket with name kk-backup-<name> in us-west-2 region in the same way as configured for the first bucket.

==
upload the image in one s3 bucket
==
Implement Cross Region Replication (CRR) from the us-east-1 bucket to the us-west-2 bucket.
Name replication rule as content-backup.
All content of kk-content- bucket need to be replicated to bucket kk-backup-.
For IAM Role - Choose the Create new role option in the replication rule to provide access to the replication process.
Do replicate existing objects.
Checkout what are the available configurations and their use in S3 Replication (for further MCQ)

==
Navigate to S3 service and select the kk-content- bucket. Click on the Management tab and then click on Replication rules. Click on Create Replication rule button.
Insert Replication rule name as content-backup
==

Upload a file named "image2.jpg" to the kk-content- bucket in us-east-1 region.

After uploading, verify that the file is automatically replicated to the kk-backup- bucket in us-west-2.
Note: It might take a few minutes for changes to be reflected on kk-backup-, so you should test it after 2-3 minutes.

Can we change storage class of the object which will get replicated?

Yes, you can configure the type of storage class you want your objects to be replicated in. This can be helpful in saving cost and achieving efficiency.
