Imagine you are a Cloud Architect with a knack for crafting intricate cloud solutions. A tech company, CloudTech enterprises is looking to establish a robust and secure network architecture to enable seamless communication between their development, testing, and production environments.

As a Solutions Architect, your goal is to design a network solution that allows for efficient communication within and between VPCs across different

Your first task is to establish a secure network environment for hosting their applications within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Let's get started:

Create a VPC named vpc-1 in the desired region, using the IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16.
Once the VPC is created, create two subnets with the following information:

Subnet 1:
Name: subnet-1-1
IPv4 subnet CIDR range: 10.0.1.0/24
Subnet 2:
Name: subnet-1-2
IPv4 subnet CIDR range: 10.0.2.0/24

Note: Create the resources in us-east-1 region.
