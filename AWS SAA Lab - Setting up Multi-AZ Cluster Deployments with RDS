How it works?


In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary database (DB) instance and synchronously replicates the data to an instance in a different AZ.
When it detects a failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to a standby instance without manual intervention.

Creating an RDS Instance with Multi-AZ Support


Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, choose the us-east-1 AWS Region.
In the navigation pane, choose Databases.
Choose Create database.
To create a Multi-AZ DB cluster, make sure that Standard Create is selected.
In Engine type, choose PostgreSQL. For Version, choose the default DB engine version.
In Templates, choose Dev/Test.
In Availability and durability, choose Multi-AZ DB instance
For DB instance identifier, enter multi-az-instances-rds
Leave master user name as default value (postgres) and check Auto generate a password.
For Instance configuration, select Burstable classes (includes t classes) - db.t3.micro.
For Storage, select 20 GiB - gp2 storage. Make sure storage autoscaling is NOT checked!
Leave the Connectivity section as default values.
Turn off the Performance Insights and Enhanced monitoring and click Create Database to finish the creation process!




Database creation will take a few minutes! Wait until Multi-AZ column displays Yes, and the column Region and AZ has value, then click check to start the validation!

Is the multi-az-instances-rds database instance being created in us-east-1 region (Region & AZ column has value)?
Is the database engine PostgreSQL with the default version and size db.t3.micro?
Is the master username postgres?
Is the storage type gp2 and storage size 20GiB?
Is the Performance Insights and Enhanced monitoring being disabled?
Is MultiAZ being enabled (Multi-AZ column display Yes)?
